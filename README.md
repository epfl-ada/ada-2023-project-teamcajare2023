# Studying the evolution of gender in movies: roles given to women and public perception

## Abstract

The goal of this project is to study the roles given to women in the cinematic industry. While it might be common knowledge that the representation of women is very different from the representation of men, we want to show it with the big amount of data at our disposal. One of our goals is to create clusters of the characters in movies to get a more comprehensive view of the evolution of the roles given to women. 

Then, there are common stereotypes about different big movie industries in the world: American movies are commonly perceived as blockbusters-oriented, prioritizing entertainment, while European productions are thought to be more artistic and intellectual. Finally, the common Bollywood movie has a family-centric plot that shapes the roles given to actresses in it. Thus with our study we wish to confirm or infirm those clichés through the analysis of the roles given to women in productions from the different industries. 

## Research questions

2 axes:
- étude longitudinale de l'évolution des actrices représentées dans les films et le type de rôles qu'elles occupent
- étude de comment les films sont reçus selon la représentation des femmes dedans

## Proposed additional datasets 

IMDb ratings: IMDb (an acronym for Internet Movie Database) is an online database of information related to films, television series and more, where users can rate the films they watch from 1 to 10. We are mainly interested in the IMDb average score and number of votes per movie. The IMDb title basics and title ratings datasets have been found on IMDb (title.ratings.tsv and title.basics.tsv).
