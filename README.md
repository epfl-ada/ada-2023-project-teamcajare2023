# Studying the evolution of gender in movies: roles given to women and public perception

## Abstract

Women often face stereotypes, from traditional expectations about their domestic roles to uncertainties about their ability for leadership or physical strength, all exacerbated by societal beauty standards. The movie industry is the reflection of our society and therefore also reflects these stereotypes and inequalities. We want to analyse to what extend this is the case and in what aspects of the film industry it is the most visible.
We want to link our analysis to the region of production of the movies, indeed there are common stereotypes about different big movie industries in the world: American movies are commonly perceived as blockbusters-oriented, prioritizing entertainment, maybe more oriented towards mannhood. While European productions are thought to be more artistic and intellectual, maybe more equal in terms of gender. As well as, the Bollywood movie having a family-centric plot that shapes the roles given to actresses in it. 
To answer these questions and confirm or infirm those clichés, we will use the CMU Movie Summary Corpus dataset and focus our analysis first on getting a more comprehensive view of the evolution of the roles given to women, and then compare it in different big movie industries. 

## Research questions

Knowing that women are treated differently in the movie industry, we are interested to dig deeper:
- Explore quantitatively the extend of the inequalities in the representation of women in movies: How younger are the actresses compared to the actors ? What is the difference in the proportion of actresses and actors? What genres are more prone to inequalities ?
- Explore qualitatively how women are represented in the movies through the character types of female and male roles: what are the typical roles ? How have they evolved ?
- Understand how movies with higher proportions of women are recieved by the public, are those movies more or less popular ? how are they rated ? do they really have less comercial success than movies with more men ?
- Analyse those differences around three geographical zones we have chosen (North America, Europe, India): Are the preconceived ideas about Hollywood, Bollywood and European movie industries true when it comes to the roles of women in the plot? 

## Proposed additional datasets 

IMDb ratings: IMDb (an acronym for Internet Movie Database) is an online database of information related to films, television series and more, where users can rate the films they watch from 1 to 10. We are mainly interested in the IMDb average score and number of votes per movie. The IMDb title basics and title ratings datasets have been found on IMDb (title.ratings.tsv and title.basics.tsv). 

## Methods

J'ai parcouru le cours et on peut faire:
- Vizalisation: 
    - visualisation 2D avec des heatmaps
    - PCA
    - Log axes !!! and anaylse what distribution 
    - Use colorblind safe palettes when visualising color
    - interactive visualization framework like D3, Vincent, Bokeh
    - Annotate graphs if needed to show/underline one specific peak
- Describing data:
    - Micro-macro average
    - Hypothesis testing
    - Confidence interval
    - Pearson's correlation coef
    - Sympson paradox
